Movie Recommendations App â€“ Web Programming I Final Project

The name is a little misleading, since the app doesn't actually recommend movies to its users based on their preferences. 

How the app works:
- Home Screen shows you top rated movies of all time and a button for moving to Recommendations Screen.

- Recommendations Screen fetches most popular movies at the moment. You can filter the movies based on genre. At the bottom of a page there is a button for moving to Favorites Screen.

- In both Home, and Recommendations screens you can add movies to your favorites.

- In Favorites you can see all the movies you added there and remove movies from your favorites.

- Up in every page there is also a navigation bar, which you can use to move switch pages.

Instructions to run it:
- You need to have Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- Download the Project Files or clone the project repository from Github
- Install project dependencies --> npm/yarn install
- Now you should be able to run the server and open the app via browser (your deafult localhost)
